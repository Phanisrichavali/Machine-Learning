# Machine-Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying the Iris flower dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular and widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and serves as a good introductory example for classification problems.
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample containing measurements of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The samples are labeled with one of three possible species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
The main components of this repository are as follows:
Dataset: The iris.csv file contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. It is a comma-separated values (CSV) file, with each row representing a sample and its corresponding features and label.

Jupyter Notebook: The iris_classification.ipynb notebook is the main file that contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the machine learning model, and evaluating its performance. The notebook is documented with detailed explanations and comments to guide you through the code.

Model: The trained machine learning model is saved as iris_classification_model.pkl. This model can be loaded and used for making predictions on new, unseen data.

Requirements: The requirements.txt file lists the Python libraries and their versions required to run the code successfully. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Instructions: The README.md file provides instructions on how to set up the project, install dependencies, and run the Jupyter Notebook.
